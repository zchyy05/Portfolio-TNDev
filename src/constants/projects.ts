    description:
      "A capstone project proposes an Intelligent Traffic Violations Enforcement and Monitoring System for Sayre Highway in Valencia City, Bukidnon. Using IoT devices, cameras, and AI, the system detects vehicle speed in real time through two monitoring stations. It uses license plate recognition to calculate speed based on time and distance, automatically alerts traffic enforcers via a mobile app, and stores violation data centrally. Designed to reduce manual enforcement and improve accuracy, the system aims to enhance road safety and strengthen local traffic law enforcement.",
